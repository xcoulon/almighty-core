// NewFixture will create a test fixture by executing the recipies from the
// given recipe functions. If recipeFuncs is empty, nothing will happen.
//
// For example
//     NewFixture(db, Comments(100))
// will create a work item (and everything required in order to create it) and
// author 100 comments for it. They will all be created by the same user if you
// don't tell the system to do it differently. For example, to create 100
// comments from 100 different users we can do the following:
//      NewFixture(db, Identities(100), Comments(100, func(fxt *TestFixture, idx int) error{
//          fxt.Comments[idx].Creator = fxt.Identities[idx].ID
//          return nil
//      }))
// That will create 100 identities and 100 comments and for each comment we're
// using the ID of one of the identities that have been created earlier. There's
// one important observation to make with this example: there's an order to how
// entities get created in the test fixture. That order is basically defined by
// the number of dependencies that each entity has. For example an identity has
// no dependency, so it will be created first and then can be accessed safely by
// any of the other entity creation functions. A comment for example depends on
// a work item which itself depends on a work item type and a space. The NewFixture
// function does take care of recursively resolving those dependcies first.
//
// If you just want to create 100 identities and 100 work items but don't care
// about resolving the dependencies automatically you can create the entities in
// isolation:
//      NewFixtureIsolated(db, Identities(100), Comments(100, func(fxt *TestFixture, idx int) error{
//          fxt.Comments[idx].Creator = fxt.Identities[idx].ID
//          fxt.Comments[idx].ParentID = someExistingWorkItemID
//          return nil
//      }))
// Notice that I manually have to specify the ParentID of the work comment then
// because we cannot automatically resolve to which work item we will attach the
// comment.
func NewFixture(db *gorm.DB, recipeFuncs ...RecipeFunction) (*TestFixture, error) {
	return newFixture(db, false, recipeFuncs...)
}

// NewTestFixture does the same as NewFixture except that it automatically
// fails the given test if the fixture could not be created correctly.

	return tc
}

// NewFixtureIsolated will create a test fixture by executing the recipies from
// the given recipe functions. If recipeFuncs is empty, nothing will happen.
//
// The difference to the normal NewFixture function is that we will only create
// those object that where specified in the recipeFuncs. We will not create any
// object that is normally demanded by an object. For example, if you call
//     NewFixture(t, db, WorkItems(1))
// you would (apart from other objects) get at least one work item AND a work
// item type because that is needed to create a work item. With
//     NewFixtureIsolated(t, db, Comments(2), WorkItems(1))
// on the other hand, we will only create a work item, two comments for it, and
// nothing more. And for sure your test will fail if you do that because you
// need to specify a space ID and a work item type ID for the created work item:
//     NewFixtureIsolated(db, Comments(2), WorkItems(1, func(fxt *TestFixture, idx int) error{
//       fxt.WorkItems[idx].SpaceID = someExistingSpaceID
//       fxt.WorkItems[idx].WorkItemType = someExistingWorkItemTypeID
//       return nil
//     }))

// check that the amount of objects has been created that were demanded in the
// recipe function.
//
// In this example
//     fxt, _:= NewFixture(db, WorkItems(2))
//     err = fxt.Check()
// err will only be nil if at least two work items have been created and all of
// the dependencies that a work item requires. Look into the documentation of
// each recipe-function to find out what dependencies each entity has.
//
// Notice, that check is called at the end of NewFixture() and its derivatives,
// so if you don't mess with the fixture after it was created, there's no need
// to call Check() again.
